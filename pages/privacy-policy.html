            <p>NK Printing and Press understand the importance of protecting the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy applies to the personal information we collect, use, and disclose on NK Printing and Press (the "Site"). If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or any services offered through the Site.</p>
            <p>When we use the term "Personal Information," we mean information that relates to an individual who is directly or indirectly identifiable.</p>
            <h6 class="text-left">Collection and Use of Your Information</h6>
            <p>We collect information in order to provide the Site and its services to our users, improve the user experience and to communicate with users about the Site and its services. The information we collect from users will depend on a user's particular interaction with the Site. For example, the information we collect from users who solely navigate the Site (see, e.g. "Log File and Cookie Information" below) will differ from users who create an account/profile and/or transact for services through the Site (see, e.g. "Personal and Business Information" section below). Different portions of this Privacy Policy may apply to users at different times.</p>
            <h6 class="text-left">Information You Provide Us</h6>
            <p>In order to access and use certain areas and services of the Site, users may be asked for personally identifiable information, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identifiers, such as your name, address, contact information, etc.</li>
              <li>Commercial information, such as business name, address, contacts information, etc.</li>
              <li>Categories of personal information such as other payment information. We collect this information when you make a purchase on the Site in order to process your transaction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While you may decline to provide certain information to us, it may render you unable to access certain services and features offered through the Site. By making a purchase on the Site, you consent to our providing your Personal Information to our services providers and such third parties as we determine is necessary to process your transaction, such as financial institutions used to process the transaction. You also have the ability to access and change the Personal Information that you have provided to NK Printing and Press by use of the appropriate features on the Site.</p>
            <h6 class="text-left">Information We Collect Automatically</h6>
            <p>When you use the Site, we collect certain internet or other electronic network activity information automatically as described in this section. As discussed further below, we may use a variety of technologies to assist in collecting this information.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: #A95216">Log Files:</strong> For all users of the Site, the Site's web server uses an extended log file format which captures date and time of visit, referring address (location from which a visitor comes to the Site), type of Internet browser, and visitor's IP address. (Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP address, for identification purposes). The log file does not capture a user's email address.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: #A95216">Cookies:</strong> A cookie is a series of data characters that, when programmed into a website, is placed by the web server into the browser's application folder on your computer. Once placed onto your machine, the cookie will allow the website to "recall" you as a unique individual. The Site uses cookies to personalize information for certain segments of its customer base. In some instances, cookies are also used to associate individual customers with their information profiles where users have elected to create such a profile. For example, through the use of cookies, the Site can "recall" your user ID when you login to the Site on your computer. Should you choose to do so, cookies can be removed from your hard drive and certain web browsers can be set so that cookies are not used or saved. Please check with your browser provider for more information on removing cookies.</p>
            <p>Cookie information may allow us to determine things like the URL of the website you visited before coming to this website, the type of browser or mobile device you are using to access the Site, your IP address, language, approximate geographic location, and time zone. We, and/or our authorized third party service providers may automatically collect this information when you access and use the Site through the use of electronic tools like log files and cookies. We use this information to troubleshoot, administer the Site and its services, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized third party service providers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online tools, content, and programming.</p>
            <h6 class="text-left">Use of Information</h6>
            <p>The user information (including Personal Information) collected on the Site is used to process requests, to fulfill orders, for customer service, to market and improve NK Printing and Press products and services, to customize your experience on the Site, and to contact you with updates to the Site and other information. NK Printing and Press may also use your information to provide you with information we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive marketing information, e-mail us at <i style="color: #A95216; font-weight: 500;">info@nkprintingandpress.com</i>. E-mail messages will also provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving this information. Please note, changes to your preference may not be effective immediately.</p>
            <p>Additional reasons we may use Personal Information include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To improve and customize the Site;</li>
              <li>To provide, maintain and secure the Site;</li>
              <li>To monitor usage of the Site;</li>
              <li>For fraud prevention and detection and to comply with applicable laws;</li>
              <li>To enforce or defend our rights, ourselves or through third parties to whom we delegate such responsibilities;</li>
              <li>To share data with police, law enforcement, tax authorities or other government agencies where we have a legal obligation and to comply with applicable laws, regulations or codes of practice;</li>
              <li>To investigate and resolve complaints and manage regulatory matters, investigations and litigation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6 class="text-left">Sharing of Information</h6>
            <p>We do not share any user information obtained through the Site, unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><h6 class="text-left" style="color: #A95216;">To provide services offered through the Site</h6>
                From time to time, we will disclose your information (on a confidential basis) to agents and others that we use in the ordinary operation of the Site, such as account and billing, marketing and promotion, user experience research and surveys, website hosting and support and maintenance. We will only disclose your information to the extent required for the limited purpose of the third party providing services contracted to us so that we may service you.
              </li>
              <li><h6 class="text-left" style="color: #A95216;">With your consent</h6>
                We will share personal information with outside companies, organizations, or individuals when we have your consent to do so.
              </li>
              <li><h6 class="text-left" style="color: #A95216;">For legal reasons</h6>
                We will share user information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonable necessary to:
                <ul>
                  <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; or</li>
                  <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><h6 class="text-left" style="color: #A95216;">Business Transfer</h6>
                We may share your information in a business transfer. As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by, another company, or we may file for protection under applicable bankruptcy laws in the future. In such event, user information obtained and maintained by us, including personal information, will transfer to a successor entity in connection with the corporate merger, consolidation, and sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. User information submitted prior to any such transfer would remain subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy (as it existed on the date of the submission). However, user information submitted after a transfer to a successor entity may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.<br><br>
                Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of user information. Consistent with this policy, we do not sell personal information. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h6 class="text-left">Links</h6>
            <p>The Site may contain links to third party websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party sites. We do not exercise control over third party websites displayed as search results or links from within the Site and these third party websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. As such, we encourage our users to be aware of this fact when they leave our website and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website that they visit which collects personally-identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected on the Site.</p>
            <h6 class="text-left">Security</h6>
            <p>NK Printing and Press have security measures in place to protect customer information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ security measures to protect data, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to the Site and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.</p>
            <p>Password-protected areas of the Site can be accessed only with a valid password. Each password owner is responsible for keeping the password confidential and safe.</p>
            <h6 class="text-left">Data Subject Rights</h6>
            <p>If you are concerned about your data, you have the right to request access to the personal data which we may hold or process about you. You have the right to require us to correct any inaccuracies in your data free of charge. At any stage, you also have the right to ask us to stop using your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</p>
            <h6 class="text-left">Changes to the Privacy Policy</h6>
            <p>NK Printing and Press reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time with or without notice. Any changes will be posted on this page. NK Printing and Press encourages you to check this page regularly. If you provide information to us, access, or use the Site in any way after this Privacy Policy has been changed, you will be deemed to have unconditionally consented and agreed to such changes. The most current version of this Privacy Policy will be available on the web page at all appropriate times and will supersede all previous versions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
